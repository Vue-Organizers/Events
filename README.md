#Â Events

This repository is a first draft to allow a Vue speaker and an event organizer to share their presentation.

The main goal is to share the hard work done by a speaker on their presentation and allow event organizers and community leaders to reuse them.

# How it works (WIP)

Each root repository is a theme about Vue or tools used in the Vue ecosystem.

In each theme repository presentation are classed by year (to avoid reading an out of date presentation)

Then you have the title of the presentation that lead you to a presentation directory


# How a presentation directory need to be formated

### The README

The readme is the most important part of a prensentation directory. It give to others all the informations needed to understand the context of the presentation.

It is composed of :

- Title of the presentation (duplicate from the folder name)
- Original author
- Original first presentation language
- City and country where the first presentation was done
- (Optional) Meetup or conference where the first presentation was done
- (Optional) Public git repository to find code used in demo
- (Optional) Link to the public video that recorded the presentation
- (Optional) Links where the user can be contacted (email, discord, github repo)
- (Optional) Description

// need a first merge to get the link
See [link](this example)

### The language folder

Next to the readme it most be a folder by language. Inside each of this folder you can find the presentation itself in X.pptx or a README with a link to a public presentation (gslide, slide...)
