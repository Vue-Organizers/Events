#Â Events

This repository is a first draft to allow vue speaker and event organizer to share their presentation.

The main goal is to share the hard work done by speaker on their presentation and allow event organizer and community leader to reuse them.

# How it works (WIP)

Each root repository is a theme about vue or tools used in the vue ecosystem.

In each theme repository presentation are classed by year (to avoid reading an out of date presentation)

Then you have the title of the presentation that lead you to a presentation directory


# How a presentation directory need to be formated

### The README

The readme is the most important part of a prensentation directory. It give to others all the informations needed to understand the context of the presentation.

It is composed of :

- Title of the presentation (ducplicate from the folder name)
- Original auhor
- Original first presentation language
- City and country where the first presentation was done
- (Optional) Public git repository to find code used in demo
- (Optional) Link to the public video that recorded the presentation
- (Optional) Links where the user can be contacted (email, discord, github repo)
- (Optional) Description

// need a first merge to get the link
